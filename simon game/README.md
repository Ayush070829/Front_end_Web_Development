# Simon Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game. The game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more difficult to remember.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can interact with the game using their keyboard and mouse.
- **Level-based Difficulty**: The game starts easy and gradually increases in difficulty as the player advances through levels.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Visual feedback is provided to the player when they press buttons, along with a message displaying their current level.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key to start the game. The game will display a sequence of colors.
2. **Memorize the Sequence**: Watch the sequence of colors carefully. The game will highlight each color in order.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.
4. **Progress Through Levels**: If you successfully repeat the sequence, you will advance to the next level, where the sequence becomes longer.
5. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake, the game will display your score and restart.
